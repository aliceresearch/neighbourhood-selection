module Ensemble_Meta_Strategies

  # Define a method here for each strategy you want to expose to the simulation.
  # The strategy will be known by the name of the method, which can then be
  # specified in the simulation.yml configuration file.
  #
  #
  # You can make use of the following base selections strategy methods:
  #   broadcast
  #   smooth
  #   step
  #
  # Each one will return a Set containing the nodes selected by that strategy,
  # given the current knowledge of the node.
  #
  # You also have access to all present self-awareness information.
  # This is accessed by retrieving it from the self-awareness engine, as
  # follows:
  #
  # self.awareness.retrieve(:knowledge)
  #
  # where "knowledge" is the name of the API method provided by a self-awareness
  # capability.
  #
  # Bear in mind that this self-awareness capability may not have been enabled,
  # so it's best to check that this returns something, rather than nil. 
  #
  # For example, to ask the self-awareness engine for the last conjoint utility
  # value (a performance metric defined in the multi_attribute_utility
  # capability), do this:
  #
  # x = self.awareness.retrieve(:last_conjoint_utility)
  #
  # Other self-knowledge items include taus and possible_nodes. Take a look in
  # the relevant self-awareness capability modules for a complete list.
  #
  #
  # Other things you have access to:
  #
  #  self.random
  #    This method returns an object of type Random. You should use it for ALL
  #    your random number generating needs. Typically, get a random number by
  #    calling self.random.rand(max). In order to ensure that experiments are
  #    repeatable, do not get random numbers any other way!
  #
  #  self.debug?
  #    This is a method that returns a boolean and tells you whether or not the
  #    user wants to see debugging output. You should check if it is true before
  #    outputting anything. You might want to use the method
  #    print_selected_nodes to give helpful debugging output, as shown in the
  #    example.

  def meta_weighted_ensemble_majority_vote

    # There is a credit assignment problem that I seem unable to crack for now.
    # So, this meta stragety is the next best thing that came to mind.
    # The credit assignment problem I am talking about is the problem of 
    # assigning credit to individual base strategies given only the ensemble 
    # strategy payoff (which, in our case is the last_conjoint_utility).
    # Could not think of a way to propagate the ensemble strategy payoff back to 
    # individual strategies!
    # 
    # So, this meta strategy does the following:
    # We start with 13 possible ensemble strategies, each defined by a possible 
    # weight distribution over base strategies, e.g. all weights equal, weight 
    # of one higher than the other two, weights of two higher than the third, 
    # and ordering of the three.
    # 
    # Then a 'bandit epsilon greedy strategy' is overlaid on top of these 
    # posible ensemble strategy, and the payoffs of these strategies is updated 
    # based on last_conjoint_utility, whenever selected.
    # 
    # The ensemble strategies that the bandit selects are all probabilistic 
    # majority vote strategies, where the weights over base strategies that 
    # define the ensemble strategy act as 'weighted votes'. The sum of these 
    # weighted votes for a particular node acts as the selection probability 
    # for the node.
