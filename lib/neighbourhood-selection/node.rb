  # The first of these messages is an update of the node's connectivity, which

  # The method receives a list of the possible nodes, with which this node could
  # communicate. It passes this information to the self-awareness engine(s),
  # which update the local knowledge.
  # 
  # It then calls the self-expression engine to select the relevant
  # neighbourhood. It returns this selected relevant neighbourhood back to the

    # would do the communicating, not just the selecting, and we would have a
    # similar construct to the one above for self-awareness engines.
